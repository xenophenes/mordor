                <p>The United States PostgreSQL Association affectionately known as PgUS is a IRS 501(c)(3) public charity. Our purpose is to support the growth and education about The World's Most Advanced Open Source Database in the United States.
                  <br><br>
                  By becoming a member you will be able to influence and help how we support that growth and education.

                  Members of the PgUS are entitled to inspect the following records, some which are already publicly available while others must be requested from the Secretary (secretary@postgresql.us):
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Articles of Incorporation</li>
                  <li>Bylaws</li>
                  <li>List of all other members</li>
                  <li>List of the Board of Directors</li>
                  <li>Meeting minutes</li>
                  <li>Board of Directors</li>
                  <li>Conference Subcommittee</li>
                  <li>Resolutions</li>
                  <li>Annual financial statements</li>
                  <li>Meeting attendance</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Members may also demand a special meeting if 5% of the voting members sign and date a petition to the Secretary with the purpose or purposes of the meeting.
                  Currently, there are two regularly scheduled meetings for members. The Annual member meeting in March and the Semi-Annual meeting in October. Members are notified of exact dates at least 7 days in advance.
